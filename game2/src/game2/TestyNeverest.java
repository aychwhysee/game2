        Things to test/check
        - Player movement speed works
        - Player attack stat deals right amount of damage to mob
        - Mobs move "randomly" (at least 3 ticks in one direction, then switch)
        - Mobs run away when hit by player
        
        - Mode changes (to diff world) every x seconds/ticks
            - Need method to change between each world? Using..ticks? -shrug-
        - Player dies/game ends if they get hit in 2nd mode
        - mode changes back to regular world after set amount of time
